### About Pensieve
Pensieve started out as a way for me to track the things that happen each day. Time flies by and it helps to know what I accomplish daily. Looking back gives encouragement and a sense of progress. Pensieve isn't a to-do app. It's a celebration, a confidante, a source of confidence and achievement.

### About the developer
I've worked with Samsung, Mercedes, and Google in both official or contracting positions. The power of recording data has always stuck with me from these experiences, not just to track the flow of time and history, but also show trends and even predict where the future will go. Eventually I plan to incorporate data analytics and combine this with a web interface inspired by /r/dataisbeautiful.
